## Das Medium core website

This is Das Medium's core website. Currently it feeds content from our legacy Wordpress site.
It's based on Create-React-App TypeScript version.

It features type-safe actions for proper Redux implementation with Typescript. I organized application state blending the [Duck Pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) and [Piotrek Witek's Style](https://github.com/piotrwitek).

There are few typings that still need to be worked out, (ie. Epics, RootActions, RootState as arguments).

This website will always be a work in progress and will always feed its main content from Wordpress, because we stay true to the roots.

Front-end CSS is Bootstrap based.
